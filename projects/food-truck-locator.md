Food Truck Locator
--------

### Background
Food trucks are a common part of large cities and provide interesting and diverse culinary solutions. Their mobility allows them to serve a large number of people. However, it also makes it difficult to find them as a costumer. As a food truck owner, it is hard to know where you need to go to attract large number of people to your truck

### Challenge
We propose making a food truck locator app. It would have two parts, the customer facing and the owner facing parts. The customer facing part would, on a map, display all current trucks. It would do this by querying the owner's phone for their GPS location. This method would provide a huge advantage over twitter and schedule based competitors.

From the owners point of view, they get to see a heatmap (individual location?) of the customers using our app, perhaps specified by their food interests (mexican, italian etc...)

To do this we will need essentailly two apps, and some server to facilitate information exchange between them.
