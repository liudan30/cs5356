Emome
-------------

### Background
Emotion is what triggers people to take actions. However, current services like Yelp or YouTube can only make recommendations regardless of users' emotions. What if there is a better way to explore the best restaurants to try when you want to celebrate, the songs to listen to when you are tired after a long long day, or the movies to watch when you want to feel alive?

### Idea
- An emotion-based mobile service that provide users with various kinds of activities to do.
- Involve crowd-sourced data to provide better content.

### Challenge
- How to measure emotions with an easy-to-learn interface.
- How to provide better content that users might like.
	- How to collect and label data to help build an emotion-based recommender system.
	- How to encourage user engagement to enrich the crowd-sourced content.

### User Story
- As a user, I can specify my current emotion and see a list of recommended places to go.
