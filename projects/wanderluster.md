### Background

Have you ever visited a place, done everything according to your homework yet still feel that your experience lack a touch of local flavor? If you are someone who seeks a more in-depth experience, who has an appetite for not only the authentic food but also the culture, the sprite or even a friend of the place, you are in luck. We want to offer a bridge that connects an interested tourist to an experienced local. Through a friendly local guide, you can acquire all the information you need, especially the ones you can't find online. What we offer is not only a connection to the city of your dream but also a new perspective, a chance to see and experience the city through its citizens' eyes. 

### Challenge

For a foreigner or non-local, he might need a good way to befriend someone local. For a local person, he might be looking for a chance to befriend a person outside his usual social circle. Our goal is to create a mobile app that satisfy the need of both parties.
