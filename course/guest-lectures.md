Guest Lectures
--------------

We invite the most interesting technologists to give guest lectures.

### Structure

We have about two hours of class. There're a few possibilities, ranging from a regular lecture with slides and/or a whiteboard, a flipped classroom where you assign reading in advance of class and use the class period for Q&A or structured activities, or an informal talk without slides. However, the most successful lectures last year included some element of live coding, so we are asking you to at the very least show some running code within any of these options.

### Logistics

See [logistics](logistics.md) for class hours and other details.
