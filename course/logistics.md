### Grading

Your grade in the course will be determined by a sum of points you individually earn.

You can accumulate points by doing the homework and building a great project.  The majority of the points are earned through doing the project.  If you work individually, point-accounting is trivial.  If you work as a team, the points you earn are determined by the product of the *points for the work* x *your understanding of the work*.  Points for the work and your understanding for the work will be judged in an in-person interview taking ~20 mins during finals week, by class staff.

There are 5 buckets you can earn points in, based on the *scope*, *quality* and *your understanding* of the work.

The buckets are:

1. *Front-End* (includes web and mobile clients)
2. *API Logic* (e.g. a REST API)
3. *Processing* (e.g. non-trivial algorithms, bit-coin interaction, ML systems)
4. *Storage* (e.g. S3, Database tech)
5. *DevOps* (e.g. Continuous Integration, Deployment and Monitoring, SDLC infrastructure)
